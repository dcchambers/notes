- **Seed** - New content planted less than 1 month ago
- **Sprout** - Content planted 1 month to 1 year ago and regularly tended
- **Mature** - Content that is > 1 year
- **Fruiting** - Content that is > 1 year and has been updated > 1 time in the last year. Content that is mature and has the potential to grow lots of new ideas.
- **Decaying** - Content that has not been tended in over two years

The goal is to automatically assign a growth status to each note in a [[Digital Garden]] based on `created` and `updated` values from the front-matter metadata.
