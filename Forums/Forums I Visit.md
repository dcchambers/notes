I've been a [reddit](https://reddit.com) user for a long time, but given some recent changes to their API and third-party-app policy, I have [decided to re-invest some time in visiting and contributing at various independent forums](https://chambers.io/2023/06/11/back-to-forums.html). This list keeps track of (some of) them.

P.S. I had no idea but [[discourse]] is pretty freakin' great.
